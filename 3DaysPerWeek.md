## Tips

### 1. **Nutrition & Eating Before/After Training**
- **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before):** A balanced meal with carbs, protein, and a small amount of fat will fuel your workout.
  - Examples: Whole grain toast with peanut butter and banana, oatmeal with protein powder and berries, or brown rice with chicken.
- **Post-Workout (30-60 minutes after):** Refuel with a combination of protein and carbs to support muscle recovery.
  - Examples: Protein shake with a banana, grilled chicken with quinoa and veggies, or Greek yogurt with honey and granola.
- **Hydration:** Drink water before, during, and after your workouts to stay hydrated.

### 2. **Supplements**
- **Pre-Workout:** Some people find that pre-workout supplements with caffeine (for energy) and creatine (for strength) can enhance their performance.
- **Post-Workout:** Whey or plant-based protein powder can help you meet your protein needs. A good recovery shake should contain 20-30g of protein.
- **General Supplements:**
  - **Omega-3s** for joint and heart health.
  - **Multivitamins** to ensure you're getting essential micronutrients.
  - **Electrolyte drinks** for longer runs to replenish sodium and potassium.

### 3. **Sleep**
- **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for **7-9 hours** of quality sleep per night to allow your muscles to recover and support overall health.
- **Sleep Tips:**
  - Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on rest days.
  - Avoid caffeine 6-8 hours before bedtime.
  - Create a relaxing pre-bed routine (e.g., reading or stretching) and limit screen time.
  - Make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet for optimal sleep.
