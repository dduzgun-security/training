## Tips
### 1. **Nutrition & Eating Before/After Training**
- **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before):** Focus on a balanced meal with carbs, protein, and a bit of fat. Carbs fuel your workouts, while protein supports muscle repair. Examples:
  - Whole grain toast with peanut butter and banana
  - Oatmeal with protein powder and berries
  - A small portion of brown rice with chicken and veggies
- **Post-Workout (30-60 minutes after):** Refuel with a combination of protein and carbs to aid recovery and muscle repair. Avoid skipping this window! Examples:
  - Protein shake with a banana
  - Grilled chicken with quinoa and roasted veggies
  - Greek yogurt with honey and granola
- **Hydration:** Always drink water before, during, and after your workouts to stay hydrated.

### 2. **Supplements**
- **Pre-Workout:** Some people like to take a pre-workout supplement containing caffeine (for energy), creatine (for strength), and beta-alanine (for endurance). Be sure to check for any potential side effects or sensitivities.
- **Post-Workout:** Protein powder can help you hit your protein goals if you find it hard to get enough from food alone. Whey or plant-based protein are good options.
- **General Supplements:**
  - **Omega-3s** (for joint and heart health)
  - **Multivitamins** (to ensure micronutrient intake)
  - **Electrolyte drinks** for longer runs (to replenish sodium and potassium).

### 3. **Sleep**
- **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for **7-9 hours** of sleep per night to allow your body to recover and repair muscles. Quality sleep is crucial for performance gains and injury prevention.
- **Sleep Tips:**
  - Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on rest days.
  - Avoid caffeine 6-8 hours before bed.
  - Create a bedtime routine to wind down, such as reading or stretching, and avoid screens (phones, computers) before sleep.
  - Keep your bedroom cool and dark for optimal rest.
