## Tips

### 1. **Nutrition & Eating Before/After Training**
- **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before):** A light meal with carbs and protein will give you energy for your workout.
  - Examples: Whole grain toast with peanut butter, oatmeal with berries, or a smoothie with fruit and protein powder.
- **Post-Workout (30-60 minutes after):** Focus on protein and carbs to help your muscles recover and replenish glycogen.
  - Examples: Grilled chicken with brown rice, protein shake with banana, or Greek yogurt with honey and nuts.
- **Hydration:** Ensure proper hydration before, during, and after workouts to avoid dehydration.

### 2. **Supplements**
- **Pre-Workout:** A small caffeine-based supplement may help boost energy, but avoid large doses if you're sensitive to stimulants.
- **Post-Workout:** Protein powder (whey or plant-based) is an easy way to support muscle repair after training.
- **Electrolytes:** If you're running longer distances or sweating heavily, consider an electrolyte supplement or sports drink.
- **Omega-3s:** Support joint health and reduce inflammation with omega-3 fatty acids.

### 3. **Sleep**
- **Sleep Quality:** Aim for **7-9 hours** of sleep per night. Recovery is key when training only two days a week, and quality sleep supports muscle repair and overall performance.
- **Sleep Tips:**
  - Establish a consistent sleep routine.
  - Avoid caffeine late in the day.
  - Create a calming pre-sleep environment (dim lights, avoid screens).
